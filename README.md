# Pokemon Analytics Project in Python

The purpose of this project is to solidify my technical skills in data analytics through the Python programming language, where the overall goal is to learn about the Pokemon games' evolution in popularity through VGChartz. I hope to explore how each of its games and certain common attributes or catchy elements of these pocket monsters have made such a huge impact on the franchise's success to this day through PokeAPI.

# Overview

The objective of this project is to apply programming skills and data analytics techniques (e.g., Tableau) to collect data and derive actionable insights that can be visualized, integrating object-orineted programming and API usage.

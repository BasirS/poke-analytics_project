# Pokémon Analytics Project in Python

This project explores the evolution of Pokémon games' popularity using Python and integrates data from the VGChartz dataset and PokeAPI. By leveraging programming, analytics techniques, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this project aims to analyze Pokémon games' global sales and uncover the elements contributing to the franchise's enduring success.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to:
  1. Analyze the global sales data of Pokémon games using the VGChartz dataset.
  2. Examine Pokémon-specific traits (e.g., types, abilities) through the PokeAPI    to explore their impact on the games' success.
  3. Demonstrate skills in Python programming, data visualization, and modular       code design via OOP principles.

The tools and techniques used include:
  + Python Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, requests
  + Visualization Platforms: matplotlib, Tableau
  + Object-Oriented Programming: Encapsulation of functionality into reusable          classes.

## Key Hypotheses
### Dataset Hypothesis
The commercial success of Pokémon games is significantly influenced by key attributes like platform availability, regional sales trends, and franchise timelines. Games released during peak franchise moments (e.g., new generation launches) or on widely adopted platforms (like Nintendo DS) outperform others globally.

### API Hypothesis
The success of Pokémon games is deeply rooted in internal elements like the design of iconic Pokémon (e.g., Pikachu), their abilities, and type combinations. Pokémon with unique traits or pivotal roles in the storyline significantly boost their games’ appeal and popularity.
